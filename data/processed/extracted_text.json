This Hand book endeavors to \nincorporate the major changes in HR policies of NBCFDC since inception of the \nCorporation.  \nThe employees of NBCFDC have been exposed to tremendous challenges \nin reaching out to the needy target group on Pan India basis and help in their \nsocio economic developments.    It is therefore a matter of pride that NBCFDC \ndown the years has developed a  treasure of invaluable manpower asset whose \ncontribution towards performance of the Corporation has been outstanding.   \nDespite the not for profit nature of the Company and the ever increasing \ncompensation requirements in terms of government guidelines, the Corporation \nhas managed to meet its targets due to diligent use of its funds on one hand and \nrationalizing of the manpower requirement on the other.  HR policy will continue \nto provide the necessary impetus of motivation and high morale among our \nemployees, which are undoubtedly necessary to meet  future challenges. \n \nThis Hand Book will further fulfill the objective of having a fair and \ntransparent HR policy and will serve as a ready reckoner for the employees.   I \ncompliment the HR Department for their efforts in developing and updating the \nHR policy and look forward to its continued updation in the years to come. \n \n12th  July, 2018 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   Managing Director\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFORWARD \nThe Hand Book is published with an objective to provide information and \nknowledge about the existing HR policy in a lucid manner. The Hand Book \nprovides the basic ideas about existing HR policies and wherever details of any \nspecific policy is required, a reference should to be made to the original policy \ncirculars. \nAn Organization exists in a state of perpetual change and so do its HR policies, \nwhich are reviewed and amended or added as per the changing requirements \nof the organization. The policy is also required to meet the ever changing \naspirations of the employee commensurate while not compromising on the \norganizational objectives. HR policy & Strategy is meant to keep the employee \nin a motivated state and to take-up challenges and convert it into opportunities \nfor higher productivity and overall value addition. \nI hope that all the employees of the Corporation will find this Hand Book useful \nand valuable.    \nThe Hand Book epitomizes our endeavor to keep the employees abreast with \nthe updated policies and to enable them to take informed decisions as far as \npersonnel policies are concerned. It is worth mentioning that our policies and \noriginal circulars are the basis on which this Handbook has been prepared in an \nabridged form.  Therefore, the said policies and original circulars will prevail in \ncase of any ambiguity arising in this abridged statement. \nWe are thankful to all members of NBCFDC family ably led by Managing \nDirector, who have provided inputs through both guidance and suggestions for \nupdating the HR policies and thereby supported the core team to carry out the \ntask of bringing out this lucid handbook.  We are at the same time open for \nsuggestions that would add value to this document in the common interest of the \norganization. \n   \n \n12th July, 2018 \n \n \n \n \n \n        (V.R.CHARY) \nDy.General Manager (HR & Admn.) \n \n \n \n \n \nI   GENERAL CONDITIONS OF SERVICE \n1.1  \nDATE OF BIRTH \n(i)   At the time of appointment to the services of the corporation, the age of an employee \nshall not be less or more than whatever has been prescribed in the selection process \nand not less than 18 years under any circumstances.

The plan option once chosen at inception cannot be changed during the policy term.\nPremium will vary depending upon the Plan Option chosen.\nLevel Cover Benefit:\nUnder this Plan option, the Absolute amount assured on death would remain level throughout the policy term.\n(#please refer section 'Benefits in Detail' for description of Death Benefit and in-built features under the product)\nIncreasing                     Cover                   Benefit With time, your responsibilities grow, the inflation goes up, and so your insurance cover should be able to keep up with these increases. The increasing cover benefit puts your insurance cover on an “increase” mode automatically, so that your security is enhanced with time without you having to manage the same.\nUnder this Plan option, the Absolute amount assured on death would increase by 10% of the Basic Sum Assured at the end of every 5th policy year, subject to a maximum increase of up to 100% of Basic Sum Assured.\nThis increase will not be applicable once the Life assured attains the age of 71 years.\nThe premium shall depend on the basic sum assured chosen at inception of the policy & the premium remains constant         throughout         the         policy        term. For example: If a policy is issued for a Life Assured aged 35 years and Basic Sum assured of ₹1,00,00,000 for a term of\n30 years, and if the death occurs in 14th policy year, the sum assured payable on death would be ₹1,20,00,000\n(₹1,00,00,000 + 2 increases of 10,00,000 each), provided the policy is in-force.\n(#please refer section 'Benefits in Detail' for description of Death Benefit and in-built features under the product)\nLevel        Cover     with       Future       Proofing       Benefit With changes in your personal and financial needs, it is not always possible to buy a new additional insurance coverage each time. Thus, to ensure that your protection cover matches with the changes in your responsibilities at important life stages, this option has been designed. The Level Cover with Future Proofing Benefit empowers you with the choice of managing your protection based on defined life-stages.\nUnder this plan option, the life assured has a choice to increase Absolute Amount assured on Death on attaining certain Life Stages during the policy term, without further medical underwriting, applicable from next policy anniversary following the acceptance of the request for the increase.\nThese Life Stages and the corresponding increase in the Absolute Amount assured on Death are as follows:\n^This facility is available only once during the policy term provided a house is purchased after the risk commencement date.\n3\nIt is your discretion whether to exercise any of the above Sum Assured increments available under this option on happening of respective events. In case you decide to exercise this option, then\nthe corresponding increase in premium on account of increase in Sum Assured will be applicable from the time of increase in the Sum Assured. Both increase in premium and increase in Sum Assured will apply prospectively from the policy anniversary date immediately falling on or after the date of acceptance of the request.\nthe premium rate applicable for increased Sum Assured would depend on the attained age and outstanding policy term at the time of exercising the option.\nthe Life Assured will not be subjected to any underwriting except for the requirement to submit valid documents to support the fulfillment of the conditions required for exercising the option.\nIn case of the birth of twin children or triplets etc, only two increases shall be allowed and the options for increase on birth of first child and on birth of second child can be exercised at the same time on submission of necessary proof\nConditions applicable for this option:\nThe increment in Sum Assured basis attaining any of the Life Stage can be exercised from 1st policy anniversary onwards.\nThis option is available only for the Regular Premium policies.\nThe policy needs to be in force at the time of exercising the option, i.e. at the time of requesting for increase in Sum Assured when attaining certain life stage\nThe increments in Sum Assured will not be allowed if a claim on any in-built benefit or rider benefit has already been made.\nAt the time of exercising the option, outstanding policy term at the time of exercising the option is equal to or higher than minimum Policy Term allowed under the product.\nThe life Insured's attained age is 45 years or below at the time of exercising the option\nThe Life Insured needs to submit a written request within a period of six (6) months from the date of occurrence of any of the above mentioned four (4) lifestage events.\nThis option can be made available to the Life Assured if the policy is accepted at Standard rates at Policy inception as per the Board Approved Underwriting Policy of the Company and also the further increase in Sum assured would not be allowed after the date of revival, if the Life Assured is accepted at substandard rates at the time of revival, as per the Board Approved Underwriting Policy of the Company.\n(#please refer section 'Benefits in Detail' for description of Death Benefit and in-built features under the product)\n4\nSample Illustration for Level Cover with Future Proofing Benefit\nMr. Karan Mehta, a 30 years old software engineer buys the “Level Cover with Future Proofing Benefit” plan option of SBI Life- eShield Next for a policy term of 20 years & Basic Sum Assured of ₹1 Crore.\nHe gets married after 2 years and feels that with this increase in responsibility, he should opt for a higher Sum Assured.
